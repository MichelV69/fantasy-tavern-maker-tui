'*The Spring Ice*' is the local Pub and Bed House for travellers in this area. The comfortable-quality establishment would be considered large-sized, with 13 tables.

It has 15 tent beds in the common room and 13 private rooms. Rooms are *8sp* per day, and meals are *5sp* per day.

As you enter, the air is full of the scents of fresh linen and the outside surroundings. The current patrons seem to be a flirty bunch,  and the main area is shadowly illuminated by oil lamps.  A sign hung from the fireplace mantle says _'Aventurers welcome (12 percent off!!)'_.

The menu has the usual standard fare posted. The House specialty beverage is the House's own pear Cider, for 20 copper, while the House specialty dish is fire roasted pheasant served with roasted forest nuts, for 31 copper.
