=====================
 
For the Characters
------------------
 
'*The Autumn Chalice*' is the local Pub and Bed House for travellers in this area. The comfortable-quality establishment would be considered modest-sized, with 10 tables.

It has 12 single beds in the common room and 5 private rooms. Rooms are *8sp* per day, and meals are *5sp* per day.

As you enter, the air is full of the scents of hot bread and the outside surroundings. The current patrons seem to be a shady bunch,  and the main area is evenly lit by magic orbs and crystals.  A sign hung from the fireplace mantle says _'Adventurers can eat but no alcohol or rooms'_.

The menu has the usual standard fare posted. The House specialty beverage is an imported hoppy Ale, for 26 copper, while the House specialty dish is stuffed and bacon wrapped venison served with hot cream, for 25 copper.
